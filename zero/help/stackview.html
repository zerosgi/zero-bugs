<h1>The Stack View</h1>
<p>
The stack view is the list located above the source code view and
 under the <a href="locals.html">local variables view</a>. It shows
 the current stack trace.</p>
<p>Single-clicking on an entry in the stack view switches the code
 view, as well as the variables view, to the scope of the selected
 stack frame</p>
<p>
<font color="green"><b>Notes:</b></font> 
By default, the debugger attempts to use stack unwinding
 information generated by the compiler, when available, rather than using
 the frame pointer register. This enables debugging programs
 compiled with <i>-fomit-frame-pointer</i>.
<p>
However, the STABS debug format does
 not provide frame unwinding information. Older versions of GCC such 
 as 2.95 did not use the DWARF format by default. If you have an older
 GCC, compile your programs with <i>-gdwarf-2</i>, or <i>-gdwarf-2<b>n</b></i>, 
 where n is the debug level, 3 being the most verbose.
