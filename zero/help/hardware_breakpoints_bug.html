   <p>Breakpoints may not work as expected when running on top of a virtual
           machine such as VirtualPC, VMware or VBox. The workaround is to disable
           hardware breakpoints in ZeroBUGS: either set ZERO_HARDWARE_BREAKPOINTS to
           false in your environment, or pass the --no-hw-bp switch to the command line
           (the workaround does not apply to data breakpoints, AKA watchpoints).
