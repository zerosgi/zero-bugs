<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
The debugger can work in either text (console) mode, or in graphical user 
 interface mode. The text-based interface is somewhat GDB-like, and
 may come in handy on systems that don't have X-Window, or when debugging
 over a slow dial-up line.</p>
<p>
The debugger has a <a name="#ld_path">plug-in (or component-based) architecture</a>. 
 At its core it has the main executable (the debugger engine).
<br>
<br><font face="courier">
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<br>${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/zero/bin</font></p>
<p>
Additional components, or plug-ins, include: the GUI, debug information
 decoders for the DWARF and STABS formats, and more optional extensions.</p>
<p>
If the environment variable named <a name="#plugin_path">
ZERO_PLUGIN_PATH</a> is set, then it is 
 treated as a colon-delimited list of paths to be searched for plugins;
 otherwise, assuming for example, that the debugger is installed in 
 /usr/local/zero/, all shared objects in /usr/local/zero/plugin will be
 automatically probed when the program starts; if the path exists, the
 shared objects that are detected as valid plug-ins are loaded. </p>
<p>
The modular architecture gives the user the flexibility to decide what 
 plug-ins should be used for a given task. Plug-ins can be organized 
 into different directories, or moved around, so that only the ones that 
 are needed are loaded.</p>
<p>
One can have two plug-in directories, and only one containing the GUI (zgui.so) 
 plugin; by making ZERO_PLUGIN_PATH to point
 to one directory or the other, the debugger can be launched in text or graphic mode.
<br>
<font color="green"><b>Note:</b></font>
Another method for selecting between the text and graphic modes is
 to launch zero with the <i>--ui-disable</i> command line option.
<br>
For a similar reason, if you know that your application is built with
 STABS debug symbols precisely (the default for older compilers such as
 GCC 2.95), then there's no need to load the DWARF reader into memory.
