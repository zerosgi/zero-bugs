<h1>The Threads View</h1>
<p>
The threads view is located in the right-upper side of the debugger window
 (under the <a href="locals.html">local variables view</a> and above the
 <a href="registers.html">registers view</a>).
</p>
 <p><font color="green"><b>Note:</b></font> 
 The ID displayed under the "Thread" column is the internal task ID
 by which threads are known to the kernel, and not the id returned by the 
  <code>pthread_create()</code> call. The pthread ID can be seen in a tooltip, 
  when moving the mouse over the items.</p>
<p><font color="green"><b>Note:</b></font> 
 The pthread ID is not available for threads read from a core dump.
 No pthread ID is available for single-threaded programs.
</p>
<p>Single-clicking on a thread in the tree switches the view to the context of
 that thread (this includes code code, <a href="stackview.html">stack view</a>,
 registers and variables).
</p>
<p>
For simplicity, processes created with the <code>fork</code> system call
are shown in this view as well (they are marked distinctively from threads created with 
the <code>clone</code> call).
</p>
<p>
The "Debug" column allows the user to control which threads
are of interest for debugging. If a box in this column is not checked, 
then the execution will not break into the debugger when signals occur in 
the corresponding thread.
