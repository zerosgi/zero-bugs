<h1>Evaluating Expressions</h1>
<p>
The "evaluate" feature allows you to view the value of a variable (local, global or 
 a class member); it also allows you to evaluate a C++ expression. To access this
 feature, select <i>Tools</i>, then <i>Evaluate</i> from the menu bar, then type
 in the variable name or expression, and click the Evaluate button.
<p>
Another, quicker way to bring up the Evaluate dialog is to point the mouse at a variable
 name in the source code view, and then click the right mouse button; from the floating
 menu that pops up, select <i>Evaluate</i>.
<p>
The built-in expression interpreter can evaluate a one-line C++ expression that may
 contain C-style or C++ casts and function calls. The expression may also contain
 array subscripts, and pointer dereferencing; the comma operator is currently not supported.
<p>
Evaluating expressions that contain C++ operators may result in a function call, if any of 
 the operators has been overriden.
<p>
When a virtual member function call appears in an expression, and the function is called
 by pointer or reference, the interpreter tries to locate the function by its offset
 in the virtual table; if not found, it falls back to trying the statically bound function.
When the function is called via the dot operator and the left side of the dot is an object,
 then the interpreter uses static binding, and the virtual table is not used.
<p>
Type and variable declarations are not allowed. The interpreter uses the ELF symbol tables
 and the available debugging information to locate variables and type information.
<p>
Templates that have not been instantiated in the debugged code cannot be evaluated.
<p>
Expressions are evaluated in the scope of the currently selected stack frame; as an exception
 to this rule, expressions may be evaluated in the scope of a breakpoint, when used as conditions
 for activating the breakpoint. 
<p>
In addition to variables, you can also reference CPU registers in expressions (esp, eip, 
 and so on). It is recommended that you prefix the register name with a percentage sign
 (prefer <i>%eax</i> to <i>eax</i>) to avoid possible conflicts with variable names. 
 Variables declared in your program always take precedence over register names, if the
 percent sign is not used.
