<h1>Signals</h1>
<p>
When one of the threads belonging to the debugged program receives a signal,
 an event occurs in the debugger; the debugger can react by stopping and
 prompting the user for a command (an action).</p> 
<p>
 The debugger normally delivers the signal to the debuggee after that</p>
<p>You may tell the debugger not to stop (not to prompt you for a command)
 when a signal occurs, and also not to re-deliver that signal to the debugged
 program; to specify the desired behavior, go to the <i>Edit</i> --&gt;
<i>Options</i> menu, and select the <i>Signals</i> tab.
