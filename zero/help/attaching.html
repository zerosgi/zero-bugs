<h1>Prepare Your Program for Debugging</h1>
<p>
<i>See also: </i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging_data_format">Debug Formats</a>
</p>
<p>
The debugger supports the GNU C/C++ compilers, version 2.95 and up.
To enable debugging of your programs, the compiler must include 
debugging information in the executables that it builds. To this end, you can 
specify one of the following command line options when compiling your programs:</p>
<p>
<li><i>-g</i> to generate debug information in the default format</li>
<li><i>-gstabs+</i> to generate debug information in the extended STABS format. Please note that
even though the <i>-gstabs</i> option is also supported, it will generate lesser information than the 
<i>-gstabs+</i> options; namely, member function information for C++ classes will not be
emitted. For C++ programs, use the <i>-gstabs+</i> option, or</li>
<li><i>-gdwarf-2</i> for debug information in the DWARF2 format. This is the
 default for GCC 3.2 and above, and it is the recommended format for large C++ programs. 
 The DWARF format is superior to STABS. The former allows for accelerated (or indexed)
 queries, while the latter imposes a linear complexity on accessing symbol and type
 information.</li>
</p> 
<p>It is highly recommended that you turn off code optimizations (with the gcc <i>-O0</i>
 command line flag).
</p>
<p>There are three ways you can debug a program:
<p>
<li><a href="#attach">attach</a> to a running process</li>
<li>execute a process from the debugger</li>
<li><a href="#core">load a core file</a> that was dumped to disc when a program crashed</li><br></p>
<p>
<h1>Executing Programs</h1>
<p>
To execute a program from under the debugger, go to the <i>File</i>
 menu, then select <i>Execute</i>. The dialog box that pops up lets you select the 
 executable file. If the name of the executable file contains white spaces, 
 make sure to surround the filename with double quotes.
</p>
<b><font color="green">Note:</font></b>
In text (console) mode, use the <code>exec</code> command.
<p>
 By default, the program inherits the current environment, but you can
 add, remove, or edit the environment variables that are passed to the new process.
 To do so, in the <i>Execute</i> dialog, press the <i>Environment</i> button.
</p>
<br>
<a name="#attach"><h1>Attaching to Running Programs</h1></a>
<p>
To attach to a running process, select <i>File</i>, then <i>Attach</i>. This brings
 up a dialog that lets you select from a tree of running processes 
 (processes with higher privileges than your account are not shown).
</p>
<br>
<a name="#core"><h1>Loading a Core Dump</h1></a>
<p>Core files, or core dumps, are produced by the operating system when an application
 crashes (typically because it has received a signal that was not handled internally).
 This debugger can load core files so that applications can be debugged "post-mortem".
<p><b><font color="green">Note:</font></b>
Some shells may disable the generation of core dumps by default. To learn 
 more about how to enable core dumps, please consult your shell's manual pages. For 
 example, the Bourne Again Shell command for turning on core dumps is:<br>
 <code>ulimit -c unlimited</code></p>
<p>
To load a core file, select <i>File</i>, <i>Open</i>, <i>Core File</i>. The dialog that
 pops up lets you browse through core files and select the one that you wish to look at.</p>
<br>
<b><font color="green">Notes:</font></b>
<li>When you execute the debugged process from the debugger, when you detach,
 or quit the debugger, the spawned process and all of its threads will be
 killed.</li>
<li>When you attach to an already running process, detaching will not kill it.</li>
<li>When you load a core file, certain functions such as setting a breakpoint
 are not available (since they require a live process to work).</li>
<br>
<p>In text mode, you can use the following commands:
<li>attach</li>
<li>exec</li>
<li>loadcore</li>
</p>
In text mode, type:<br>
<code>help &lt;command&gt;</code><br>
(where &lt;command&gt is one of the above) for more details.
