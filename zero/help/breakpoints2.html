<h1>Setting Breakpoints</h1>
<p>
To set a code breakpoint, go to the <i>Breakpoints</i> menu, then 
 <i>New Breakpoint</i>. In the entry dialog, type either the fully qualified name
 of a function, or an address.</p>
<p>
Another way of setting a breakpoint is to right-click on a line of code
 and select <i>Insert Breakpoint</i> from the popup menu.
</p>
<a name="#modif_bpnts"><h1>Modifying Breakpoints</h1></a>
<p>
Activate the right-click menu on a line of code where a breakpoint
 exists. Select either <i>Remove Breakpoint</i> or <i>Disable Breakpoint</i>.
</p>
<p>An alternative way of deleting and disabling breakpoints is to select
 <i>Edit</i> from the <i>Breakpoints</i> menu; A dialog box that contains 
 a list of all breakpoints pops up. Select the breakpoints that you want
 to modify, then right-click on the list. A popup menu will present you 
 with the <i>Disable</i> and <i>Remove</i> options. The menu options apply to
 all selected breakpoints. Press the OK button at the bottom of the dialog
 box to commit the changes.
</p>
<a name="#cond_bpnts"><h1>Conditional Breakpoints</h1></a>
<p>
The debugger supports specifying conditions for breakpoints. Conditions
 are specified as C++ <a href="quickview.html">expressions</a>
 that are evaluated in the scope of the breakpoint. The debugger will stop the 
 debugged program at the location of the breakpoint only if the logical condition is met. 
</p>
<p>
 To specify the activation condition for a breakpoint, select <i>Edit</i>
 from the <i>Breakpoints</i> menu, and select the desired breakpoint from the list.
 This will enable the bottom part of the dialog, where you can enter the conditions.
 Hit OK when done. Please note that the changes are not committed if you close the
 dialog without hitting OK. The bottom part of the dialog is enabled only when
 exactly one selection is made in the list of breakpoints.
</p>
<p>
 Some bugs may happen only after N iterations through a loop.
 It is useful to be able to specify the number of hits as a condition for 
 activating a given breakpoint. You can use the <i>Activate after ... hits</i> 
 feature to this purpose. The number of hits can be reset by hand (press the
 <i>Reset</i> button) or automatically, after the threshold value is met
 (use the <i>Auto-reset</i> check box).
</p>
<p>
If auto-reset is not specified, then the breakpoint will fire every time once the
 threshold condition is met. Auto-reset downs the hit count back to zero after the
 threshold is met. By specifying a threshold and auto-reset, you are telling the
 debugger to activate a breakpoint every N times. 
</p>
<p>
If both a conditional expression and a hit threshold are specified, then hits are
 counted only when the expression yields true.
</p>
<p>

Expressions that yield void evaluate to false.

An interesting use for the conditional breakpoints is to test a small patch 
 without having to rebuild the debugged program. Consider, for example, that
 you have a theory that some bug may be caused by an uninitialized variable.
 You can insert a breakpoint and enter <i>i = 0</i> as the condition (or
 <i>(i = 0) || 1</i> if you want the debugger to stop at the breakpoint). The code
 will be invoked every time the breakpoint is reached, and thus patch the debuggee
 on-the-fly. If you need to initialize the value to something else than zero,
 but do not wish the debugger to stop at the breakpoint, use the expression
 <i>(i = 42) && 0</i>.
</p>
<p>
<font color="green"><b>Note:</b></font>
The conditional expression is not validated when entered in the dialog.
 If any error occurs at evaluation-time, the debugger will stop at the 
 breakpoint.
