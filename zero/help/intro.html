<h1>Introduction</h1><br>
<p>
This is a debugger for Linux user-mode programs written in C/C++.</p>
<p>
Although debugging programs written in other compiled languages such 
 as Fortran or Ada might work, this is not tested.
 The debugger is designed with C/C++ in mind.  </p>
<p>
The  debugger handles multithreaded applications, and it supports both the older 
 pthread library (Linux Threads) and the new NPTL (Native Posix Thread
 Library).</p>
