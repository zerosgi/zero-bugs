   <p>Visualization of STL strings and containers may not work with 
      implementations other than the one that ships with GCC.  </p>

   <p>To make the debugger work with other vendors the .zero.py file 
   that currently ships with the debugger 
   (and is installed in the plugins directory) needs to be modified.</p>
   <p>
   The script implements the
   <a href="pyexample.html#on_debug_symbol">on_debug_symbol</a> callback
    which transforms STL internal structures into user-friendly
    representations.
