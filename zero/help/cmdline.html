<h1>Command Line Options</h1>
<p>
<b>Synopsis:</b><br>
zero [progname | corefile] [arg [arg]]
<p>
<i>arg</i> may be either a command line option for the debugger, or
an argument for the debugged program.
Arguments that follow the program name, and do not start with a dash,
are passed as command line arguments to the debugged program. 
<p>If you need to pass to the debuggee an argument that
contains spaces, then you need to put double quotes around it.
<p>
Arguments starting with a dash are passed to the debugger engine and to the
plug-ins. If you need to pass command line arguments starting with a dash to
the debugged program, prefix them with a standalone, double dash.
For example: <i>zero foo -v --main</i> passes -v and --main to the debugger engine,
while: <i>zero foo -- -v --main</i> passes -v and --main to the debugged program <i>foo</i>.
<p>
Debugger engine command line options:
<li>
<i>--break-on-throw</i>: stop target execution before throwing an exception
</li>
<li>
<i>--cache-disable</i>: do not cache debug information from one run to another.
</li>
<li>
<i>--main</i>: automatically position at main, and start debugging
 from there, skipping the startup code. This is not the default, since
 it does not apply to: programs that don't have a <b>main</b> function,
 programs that have not been executed from under the debugger, and 
 post-mortem debugging.
 This is equivalent to setting the ZERO_START_MAIN
 environment variable to true.
</li>
<li><i>--no-banner</i>: do not display copyright and version info to console
when starting up the debugger
</li>
<li>
<i>--no-hw-bp</i>(no hardware breakpoints): disable usage of
hardware breakpoints, works around a bug in Virtual PC.
 This is equivalent to setting the ZERO_HARDWARE_BREAKPOINTS
 environment variable to zero (or false).
</li>
<li>
<i>--no-trace-fork</i>: do not trace into forked processes
</li>
<li>
<i>--syscall-break</i>: break into the debugger each and every time the debugge
is about to enter and leave a system call.
</li>
<li>
<i>-v</i>: development builds only: print verbose information to console.
</li>
<li>
<i>--dwarf-nofh</i>: disable frame handlers in the dwarf plugin; frame handlers
read stack unwinding info from the debuggee and work with the stack unwinder.
Frame handlers are enabled by default.
</li>
<li>
<i>--ui-disable</i>: do not activate the UI plugin even if
found in the <a href="environ.html#plugin_path">plugin path</a>
</li>
