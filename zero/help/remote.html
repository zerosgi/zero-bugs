<h1>Remote Debugging</h1>
<p>
This page describes the support for remote debugging in ZeroBUGS.

Currently, the remote debugger is not a cross-debugger, that is 
to say it only works between Linux systems with the same type of CPU. </p>
<p>
For full scale systems, remote debugging may be as simple as ssh-ing into
the target.
Installing a full-fledged debugger, with a UI-module that depends 
heavily on Gnome may not be a feasible option for small (possibly embedded) 
systems where resources are scarce.</p>
<p>
ZeroBUGS' solution for remote debugging is to install a thin, lightweight 
server on the target system, and have the debugger on a Linux workstation 
do the heavy lifting of building symbol tables, managing breakpoints, and so on.</p>
<p>
In order to read debug information, the debugger needs access to the executable and 
shared objects on the target system.  The simplest solution is just mount the remote 
target onto the machine where the debugger runs. SSHFS is ideal for this job. Because
 the debug info may contain references to absolute path, ZeroBUGS provides the 
ZERO_REMOTE_PATH environmental variable, which creates an internal mapping between 
the mount point and the original paths.</p>
<p>
Here are the steps for a remote debugging sessions, with an example where the debugger 
runs on a system named "zulu", and the target executable(s) reside on another  machine
named "arnold":</p>
<p>
1) Mount the filesystem of the target computer onto the debugger system. Example:
<code><pre>
cristiv@zulu:~/workspace/sandbox$ sudo chown cristiv /dev/fuse
[sudo] password for cristiv:
cristiv@zulu:~/workspace/sandbox$ sshfs root@10.0.1.10:/ ~/workspace/remote/
root@10.0.1.10's password:
cristiv@zulu:~/workspace/sandbox$
</pre></code></p>
<p>
2) Add mount point to remote map. Example:
<code><pre>
export ZERO_REMOTE_MAP="10.0.1.10:/home/cristiv/workspace/remote;"
</pre></code>
<br>
<font color="green"><b>Note:</b></font> each entry must be ended with a semicolon 
(even when there is only one entry in the map).</p>
<p>
3) Start the ZeroBUGS server on the remote (debug target) system:
<code><pre>
cristiv@arnold:~/workspace/zero$ zserver
*** ZeroBUGS Remote Debug Server V. 1.0 ***
*** Copyright (c) 2008 Zero Systems LLC ***
cristiv@arnold:~/workspace/zero$
</pre></code></p>
<p>
To debug remotely programs running on host 10.0.1.10:<br />
4) Run a remote program and debug it, using the command line:
<code><pre>
zero remote://10.0.1.10/home/cristiv/workspace/zero/a.out
</pre></code></p>
<p>
<font color="green"><b>Note:</b></font>
The default port used for remote debugging is 30000. To use a different port, 
start the server passing a different port number in the command line, like this:
<code><pre>
zserver --port=1234
</pre></code>
Specify the port in the client command line like this:
<code><pre>
zero remote://10.0.1.10:1234/home/cristiv/workspace/zero/a.out
</pre></code>
</p>
<p>
<font color="green"><b>Note:</b></font>
Finally, please remember that <strong>the debug server opens a security whole on 
the target systems</strong>, since the client debugger can execute any program 
that the user who started the server can. It is your responsibility to ensure
the security of the system being debugged.
