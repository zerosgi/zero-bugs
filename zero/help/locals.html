<h1>Viewing Local Variables</h1>
<p>
The debugger's window area located immediately under the menu bar and
 the toolbar displays the local variables (automatic variables
 that are visible in the current scope of execution).</p>
<p>
To hide this area, select <i>Locals</i> in the <i>View</i> menu. To
 show it again, select the menu once more.</p>
<p>
The local variables view is organized into three columns: one column
 for the variable name, another one for the value, and a third that
 displays the type. </p>
<p>Aggregated types such as structures and classes are shown in 
 a hierarchical manner, in a tree</p>
<p>Right-clicking on a row in this window area pops up a menu
 with several options. You can toggle between hexadecimal and decimal
 representations for integers, view the variable as 
 <a href="memory.html">raw memory</a> or 
 set a <a href="breakpoints.html">watchpoint</a> at the memory location
 that corresponds to the variable.</p>
<p>
 You can alter the value of a variable: double-click on it, then
 enter the new value in the edit field that pops up. Press Escape to
 abort, or Enter to accept the change.</p>
