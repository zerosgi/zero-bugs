<h1>Controlling Program Execution</h1>
<p>
As soon as the debugger attaches to a program (or a new program is
 executed from the debugger), the execution of the debuggee is stopped.
<p>
At this point, you can:
<li><a href="breakpoints2.html">insert breakpoints</a></li>
<li><a href="#step">single step</a> through the program</li>
<li><a href="#continue">continue</a> executing the program</li>
<br>
<p>
<font color="green"><b>Note:</b></font>
Most operations require the debugged program to be stopped in the debugger.
 For example, in order to insert or remove a breakpoint, you need first to select 
 <i>Program</i> -&gt; <i>Break</i> (or use the <i>Break</i>
 button from the toolbar). Once the program stops, you may proceed to the
 <i>Breakpoints</i> menu.
</p>
<br>
<a name="#step"><h1>Single Stepping</h1></a>
<p>
 You can execute the program, one step at a time, at either 
 machine level or source level. At machine level, you can execute 
 one CPU instruction at a time. This functionality can be accessed
 by selecting <i>Step Instruction</i> from the <i>Program</i> menu.
</p>
<p>
 To execute one line of source code, select <i>Step</i> from the
 <i>Program</i> menu, or press the Step button on the toolbar (if the
 toolbar is not visible, turn it on by selecting <i>Toolbar</i> in the
 <i>View</i> menu).
</p>
<p> 
 While stepping at the source level, if a function call is encountered,
 the debugger will step inside of that function. If you want to step over
 function calls (i.e. not step inside called functions) use the <i>Next</i>
 menu from the <i>Program</i> menu on the menu bar, or use the Next button
 from the toolbar.
</p>
<p>
<font color="green"><b>Note:</b></font>
When running in text mode (no graphical user interface), the
 following commands are available at the command prompt:
 <li>instruction</li>
 <li>next</li>
 <li>step</li><br>
 These work esentially the same as the menus; for more information, type:<br>
 <code>help &lt;command&gt;</code> at the prompt.
</p>
<br>
<p><a name="#continue"><h1>Resuming Execution</h1></a>
</p>
<p>To continue executing the program, select <i>Continue</i> from the
 <i>Program</i> menu. The execution will resume until either a 
 <a href="breakpoints.html">breakpoint or watchpoint</a> is hit, the program
 receives a signal, or you stop it. To stop the program, select <i>Break</i>
 from the <i>Program</i> menu, or from the toolbar.
</p>
<p>The <i>Return from function</i> menu (under <i>Program</i>) and the
 Return toolbar button allow you to resume the execution of the debugged 
 program until the current function returns to its caller. As soon as the
 function returns, the program will break into the debugger.
</p>
<p>
To continue executing the program until a given line of code is reached,
 right-click on that line and select the <i>Run To Cursor</i> menu option.
