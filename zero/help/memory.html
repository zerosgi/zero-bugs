<h1>Viewing Memory Contents</h1>
<p>
To view the contents of the memory at a given address,
 go to the <i>View</i> menu and select <i>Memory</i>. In the dialog
 box that pops up, enter the desired address, then press Enter.<p>

<p>Resize the window to view more memory. </p>
<p>
The window is modeless; you can see how the memory changes as you trace to the
program. If you wish to keep a snapshot of the memory state at a given point,
press the "Freeze View" button. This way, the window will not be updated as
memory contents change. You can open an unlimited number of memory windows.
You can open two windows for the same location, and freeze one view, so that
you can always compare the current state to the snapshoted memory.
</p>
<p>
As the contents of the memory changes, the modified bits are shown in a
different color.
</p>
<p>
Another way of selecting a memory address to view is to right-click a 
 variable in the source code, and then select 
 <a href="quickview.html">Evaluate</a>.
This brings up a window that displays the variable. Right-click on the
variable value and select <i>View Raw Memory</i>. This will display the raw
contents of the memory at the address of that variable.
