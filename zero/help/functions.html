<h1>Calling Functions</h1>
<p>The debugger has a built-in C/C++ expression interpreter that can
 be used to invoke functions defined inside the debugged program.</p>
<p>From the menu bar, select <i>Tools -> Evaluate</i>. The 
 <a href="quickview.html">Evaluate</a> dialog pops up; type
 the name of the function, with its parameters, then hit the Evaluate button.</p>
<p>When invoking a method on an object from within another method of the 
 same object, you must prefix the method with <i>this-></i>.Static methods
 must be fully-qualified, as in <i>MyClass::some_method()</i></p>
<p>
<font color=green><b>Note:</b></font> Some functions such as constructors
 and user-defined conversion operators may be called behind the scenes when
 <i>static_cast</i> or C-style cast expressions are evaluated.
</p>
<p>
<font color=green><b>Note:</b></font> The C calling convention is the only one supported
 at this time. (Parameters are pushed onto the stack starting from the right-most,
 and the caller is responsible for cleaning up the stack after the function returns).
</p>
<p>Other limitations of the expression evaluator:
<li>functions that are inlined or optimized out cannot be called</li>
<li>variables that are optimized out cannot be used in expressions</li>
<li>the comma (,) operator is not supported</li>
<li>the types used in an expression must exist in the debuggee</li>
<li>types, variables and functions in a shared library that is not loaded into
 memory may not be available</li>
<li><b>true</b> and <b>false</b> are not recognized; use 1 and 0 instead. This is
 on purpose, for backwards compatibility with C programs</li>
</p>
<p>
<font color="green"><b>Note:</b></font>
If a function invoked from the debugger causes a signal (such as SIGSEGV) to
 be raised inside the debugged program, the debugger will do its best to restore
 the CPU registers and rewind the stack; however, side-effects such as modifications
 of the memory, or I/O operations cannot be undone.
