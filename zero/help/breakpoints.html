<h1>Breakpoint Types</h1>
<p>
The debugger supports code breakpoints (or simply breakpoints), and 
 memory breakpoints (also called watchpoints).
<p>
A watchpoint is activated when a memory location is read or written, whereas 
 a code breakpoint is activated when an instruction is being executed.
<p>
To set a code breakpoint, go to the <i>Breakpoints</i> menu, and select 
 <i>New Breakpoint</i>. In the entry dialog, type either the fully qualified name
 of a function, or an address.</p>
<p>If the specified function is inside of a shared object that
has not been loaded into memory yet, the debugger scans recursively
the DT_NEEDED information in the main executable and all libraries,
and locates the shared object that contains the specified function.
It then creates a "deferred breakpoint", which becomes a true breakpoint
once the shared object is loaded.</p>
<p>
Shared objects which are loaded explicitly with <code>dlopen</code> are
not listed in the DT_NEEDED area of the ELF program, so you need
to provide the information to the debugger by using the <i>View</i>
--&gt; <i>Modules</i> menu, then click on the <i>Add Shared Object</i>
button, at the bottom of the dialog box.
</p>
<p>

The debugged program has to be stopped in the debugger in order to be able
 to set or modify breakpoints. When the program is running, the user
 interface controls for setting and editing breakpoints are disabled 
 (grayed out).</p>
<p>
 Another way for inserting breakpoints is to use the right-click menu. 
 You can
 insert a breakpoint at a given source line by right-clicking on it and
 selectind the <i>Insert Breakpoint</i> menu entry.</p>
<h1>Setting Watchpoints</h1>
<p>
Watchpoints (or memory breakpoints) allow you to monitor when a <a href="locals.html">
program variable</a> has changed value.</p>
<p>
A watchpoint can be set by selecting the <i>Breakpoints</i> --&gt; <i>Watch...</i> menu, 
 or by right-clicking a variable (in either the local variables view or the expression
 evaluation view) and selecting <i>Set Watchpoint</i> from the contextual menu.
<p>
In the first case, the dialog that pops up will prompt you to enter the address
 that you wish to monitor. In the second case, the address is automatically assumed
 to be the address of the variable that you have clicked on. If the variable is
 local (stack-based), then the watchpoint will fire only when the current function
 is active.
